## About

Skeleton of a SM64 practice ROM. While the (provisional) title ostensibly refers
to a practice ROM to be used for speedrun practice, I don't think I have (yet)
the skills and free time necessary to provide a very polished product. Indeed, I
plan to use this project more as a way to learn more about low-level programming
(at least, lower level than I'm used to), and assembly.

## Building

To compile this C hack and patch the ROM, you will need
[glank](https://github.com/glankk)'s N64
[toolchain](https://github.com/glankk/n64).

## Thanks

Thanks to [@kdjmonaghan](https://github.com/kdjmonaghan) for getting me started,
[@queueRAM](https://github.com/queueRAM) and for the general help and their
immensely useful tools, and of course [@glankk](https://github.com/glankk) for
making gz in the first place.
